Nick Beckwith is a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania with the Electrical and Systems Engineering Department. He received his B.S. in Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019. His primary interests lie in providing research infrastructures for novel cross-stack solutions in embedded systems, emerging memory technologies and tightly integrated heterogeneous systems. He looks forward to tackling the problems of a post-Moore era with these fast, novel and high fidelity research infrastructures.
