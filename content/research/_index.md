At WiCIL, our research focuses on future systems in two general directions:

1. **Augmenting computer systems with domain specific accelerators and emerging memories** -- an essential step towards next-generation systems. It requires modest system changes and has low deployment barrier but the performance gain might be potentially limited.

  * *Architecture/Algorithm Co-design*
      * Large scale graph analytics
	  * Deep learning and AI
  * *Mechanisms and Abstractions for Virtualization in Cloud*
  * *Open Source Computer System Infrastructure*
  
2. **Rethinking computer systems with post-CMOS technology** -- a more aggressive approach in pushing innovations across the entire system stack. It could lead to dramatic improvement in performance but often requires more disruptive change in both hardware and software.

  * *Liquid Silicon*
  * *Two-Dimensional Associative Processor*
